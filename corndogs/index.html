                <h4 class="corndog-question">Why?</h4>
                <p class="main-corndog-para">Honestly, I'm not really sure why. I was just working on another dev project and my mind started to
                    wonder to corn dogs. I think it might've been because a friend of mine was recently talking about
                    how his family MADE corn dogs in house. Like that's crazy, aye?</p>
                <p class="main-corndog-para">Also, who doesn't like corn dogs????</p>

                <h4 class="corndog-question">What?</h4>
                <p class="main-corndog-para">A corn dog, for those nonamerican lads and lassies, is a hot dog sausage that is then surrounded by a
                    batter and deep fried. You can think of a corn dog as just a hot dog, but americanized. Typically
                    corn dogs are associated with festivals and boardwalks. Similar to Dip n' Dots, you can seemingly
                    find corn dogs in random obscure spots as well. I've even seen corn dogs at lawyer conference halls
                    before (why i was there is besides the point) </p>
