            <section>
                <p>My name is Erol Bickici and it's great to meet you! Here is my bio that talks a bit about me so feel
                    free to read it: </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>I was born Januray 23, 2000 in New York City to two Turkish parents. I grew up in New Jersey for my
                    entire life in a small house attending all my schooling locally within my town of Closter.</p>
                <p>Overall, I was a pretty quiet lad who liked to build things creatively. I loved playing with legos
                    and would actually get bored with the instruction manuals and tended to just create my own projects
                    by combining different lego sets.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>My school life was pretty average honestly. I attended public schooling and never really excelled or
                    failed at anything. I just kind of was 'vibing' and very rarely studied (which yes, I do regret).
                    High school was a carry over with this laid back format and I realized, after doing poorly Freshman
                    year, that I really had to care about my education and my future.</p>
                <p>I managed to turn around my then near failing grades into straight A's by the end of High school and
                    even did well on my ACT and my AP tests! During this time period, I also began investing and
                    learning how to code.</p>
                <p>When it came to college, I really wanted to attend NYU for a variety of reasons that I don't wish to
                    bore you with, but long-story-short, I managed to get into NYU Shanghai. Shanghai was more of a
                    spontaneous choice for me and I felt that (again, cutting it short) only in a really uncomfortable
                    environment can I really grow. So off to China I went! </p>
                <p>In college, I am pursuing a double major in both Finance and Computer Science, so ideally I could one
                    day work in a field that beautifully mixes the two.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Passions</h3>
                <p>Sorry if I get a bit philosophical, but I feel as if having a singlular passion is rather outdated
                    and too narrow. Most people try to 'follow their passion' but in my own rather naive experience, I
                    really feel like that message is incomplete. Nobody I ever met in my entire life decided to pour
                    their
                    heart and soul into a singlular event or focus. Sure, there are people who exist like that in world
                    but for the vast majority of people, we just enjoy doing a variety of things, ands that's ok.</p>
                <p>For me personally, I love business, tech, psychology, real estate, design, painting, sales, and many
                    more (I'm also getting a little bit into bartending now and idk why)! Sure it would be best for my
                    career to focus in on just a single passion, but I want to be sure that I have time for all my other
                    desires. After all, you got to enjoy life, yea?</p>
