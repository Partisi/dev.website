    <h1>Intro to Web Design and Computer Principles</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Erol Bickici and I am a junior at NYU Shanghai who is also currently living in the great state of Jersey! I am doing a major in Computer Science and a major in Finance. I hope to work in a field that is a nice fusion between both tech and business, ideally in a fast-paced startup environment. I also like to develop small side projects and also play around with the stock market from time to time. It's also great to meet all of you :D</p>
