  <h1 class="main-web-heading">Intro to Web Design and Computer Principles</h1>
  <p class="main-para-desc">Hello! My name is Erol Bickici and I am a junior at NYU Shanghai who is also currently
    living in the great state of
    Jersey! I am doing a major in Computer Science and a major in Finance. I hope to work in a field that is a nice
    fusion between both tech and business, ideally in a fast-paced startup environment. I also like to develop small
    side projects and also play around with the stock market from time to time. It's also great to meet all of you :D
