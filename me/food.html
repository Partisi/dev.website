                <h2>Food? Food!</h2>
                <p>Who doesn't love food? Food is the embodiment of absolute pure good in the world. Food can't hurt
                    you, reject you, or make you re-evaulate your life choices (unlike some girls I've dated). Anyway, food is great and I have had the privelege of having a family that
                    encourages change and trying new things, particularly different types of food.</p>
                <p>In general, I absolutely love BBQ. The thing with a lot of food these days is that it appears that
                    the smaller the portion is, the more money is costs. Like I get it how some ingredients are coming
                    from the Sicilian Mountain ridge and picked at exactly 4:05am every Tuesday, but when I go out to
                    eat, I go with the desire to be at least somewhat full.</p>
                <p>Too many times have I gone to a restaurant and they just gave me pigeon food. I'm sure they are
                    trying their best, but I'm 6 4 and 200 pounds, so a piece of lettuce with soy sauce is NOT going to
                    fill me up. BBQ, however, is fantastic and the entire premise is to keep eating, so it has
                    quality AND quantity!</p>

                <h2>Foods I Love</h2>
                <p>I love a lot of food, but in particular, the following is a short list of my favorites!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>BBQ Ribs</h3>
                        <p>Going off what I previous said about BBQ, it is no surprise that I love ribs. For $20 you can
                            get a full rack of ribs and sides. Because I'm weird, I usually only have 1-2 meals a
                            day, so $20 for a single good day of eating is really not that shabby. I also almost forgot
                            to mention, but BBQ sauce with ribs is a combination conjured up by God himself for us to
                            enjoy. For those of you in NJ, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.cubbysbarbeque.com/"
                                target="_blank">Cubby's BBQ</a>.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Steak</h3>
                        <p>Steak is a classic meat. There really is not much to say besides the fact that cooking a
                            nice juicy NY strip on the grill is A1.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Chicken Wings</h3>
                        <p>Wings are an american classic, with a near endless amount of different sauces for different
                            occasions. Personally, I love a classic hot, honey BBQ, or an asian fusion sauce on my
                            wings.</p>
