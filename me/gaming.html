                <h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
                <p>In my life, there really are only a few things that I have been relatively consistent with over time
                    without getting bored. Even when I do tech or business, I do occasionally find myself drifting away
                    from material and becoming disinterested in particular topics.</p>
                <p>Video games for me are something that I have really always enjoyed playing to destress and relax.
                    Since I have begun college, I did really cut off gaming from my life (as it was also kinda difficult
                    to
                    setup a pc in Shanghai) and now I rarely play anymore. Even though I don't play nearly as much as I
                    used to, I do still enjoy watching youtube or twitch to pass the time while not following into a
                    similar addiction that I had before with me playing myself.</p>

                <h2>Games I'm Interested In</h2>
                <p>Here is a short list of games that I really used to enjoy playing and occasionally watch others play
                    to this day:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Call of Duty</h3>
                        <p>Game that involves shooting and is honestly just recycled over and over again each year, yet
                            still is somewhat enjoyable. Also the game that parents think their kids are playing that
                            causes violence in the real world.</p>
                        <img src="./assets/call-duty-lad.jpg" alt="call-of-duty-dude" width="120" height="80" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Overwatch</h3>
                        <p>FPS team-based game that has a variety of different engagements to complete a certain
                            objective. To this day, I still occasionally watch the <a
                                href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/" target="_blank">competitive league version</a>
                            of this
                            game, for its fast-paced playstyles. For those who are also familiar with Overwatch, I actually
                            played so much that I was a top 500 main tank before I realized I was kinda addicted and
                            quit.</p>
