                <p>Hello! I'm Erol Bickici and I like technology, business, and all things cool! If you go around these pages, you can
                    certainly learn a lot about me and what I enjoy doing! Feel free to stay around as long as you need!
                </p>
                <p>Here is my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/erol.bickici" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, if you are interested!</p>

                <p>Here is also a gif I found that pretty accurately sums me up: </p>

                <h2>What Information Can I Find Here?</h2>
                <p>In these web pages, you can find information about my hobby of gaming, foods I enjoy eating, my idea of
                    learning, and random interests I have!</p>
                <p>For any additional reference, this is what I look like: </p>
