                <h2>Business</h2>
                <p>When it comes to anything business-related, I absolutely love hustling and also earning some side
                    profit. In particular, I have been invested into the stock market since I was maybe 16 years old. I
                    started, not really to get into making money but moreso to learn and test my skills.</p>
                <p>Besides the stock market, I also do enjoy learning about new business industries. I'm currently
                    looking into
                    and understanding cryptocurrency and other areas within fintech.</p>

                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>There are many topics in technology that I really enjoy. I enjoy AI, 5G, and other emerging trends
                    within the tech field. I also do follow the work of <a href="https://deepmind.com/"
                        target="_blank">Deepmind</a> and <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/"
                        target="_blank">Boston Dynamics</a> to get a good sense
                    of current implementations within AI and robotics subsequently.</p>

                <h2>Random</h2>
                <p>I am slowly becoming obessed with the cheese run. The cheese run is basically an
                    event in England that has a bunch of people racing down a steep hill to try and catch a cheese
                    wheel. I really don't know why it's so funny and fun for me to watch, but here is a small depiction
                    of the cheese run:</p>
